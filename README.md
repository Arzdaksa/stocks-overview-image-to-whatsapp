# stocks-overview-image-to-whatsapp
hello everyone :)
This is my first git-hub upload so sorry if its not perfect

This project gets real time stocks data, edits that data to an image and then sends the image to a whatsapp group.
It was very fun working on this project, because i had to learn and use amazing python libraries like PIL and tradingview_ta.

ps: if you want to use this project, make sure to edit the code in main line 11 to a whatsapp group you want.
